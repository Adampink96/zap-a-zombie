BRAIN COLLECTOR
hello there brain collectors, hit the brain button to begin and start your journey, the more brains you collect the more upgrades you can purchase.
next to each upgrade button is the item name, cost of brains and increase to the bps (brains per second).
how many can you collect ? how much time are you will spend? only you can decide.

Reflection:
i really enjoyed working on this one, had alot of fun building the code through javascript and using the debugger to test sections to make sure they work. really feel like ive come along way since starting the course with my understanding of javascript growing daily. there were some aspects i struggled with, making things look pretty is something i find really hard, if i can have some feedback and pointers on that that would be great. I also struggled with some of the costing aspects as theres parts of the upgrades that didnt seem to correspond correctly, if i could have some feedback on that as well that would be great, could'nt work out if it was a minor mistake in my code. Really happy with how far i've come though within the backend of coding as this is somthing i really enjoy & using debugger and testing programs to make sure the site and game runs.
